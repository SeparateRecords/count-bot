# Voice Count: Assets

The following audio files must be present.

- `5.wav`
- `4.wav`
- `3.wav`
- `2.wav`
- `1.wav`
- `0.wav`

The final audio file, `0.wav`, may be over 1 second. Any other audio files over
1 second will be stopped before the next file plays, with a warning logged.

Feel free to replace these files with your own! My microphone is old and
crappy, and my room is like a cave.
